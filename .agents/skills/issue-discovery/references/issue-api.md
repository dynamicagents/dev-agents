# The issue calls

`gh` has an `issue` command, so unlike the audit's advisories most of these have a short
form and an `gh api` form. The permission named on each is the fine-grained one GitHub
answers with in `X-Accepted-Github-Permissions`; reading that header on a refusal is how
you tell a missing permission from a missing role.

## What an issue carries that an advisory cannot

Labels, assignees, milestones, a `stateReason`, comments, a task list whose boxes a fix can
tick, a body the search index reaches, and **no expiry**. Three things follow, and they are
why this run's bookkeeping is lighter than the audit's:

- **What was filed is readable at any time**, from the repositories themselves. The run
  does not depend on a report to know what earlier runs filed, only to know what they
  *attempted*, which is the half no issue records.
- **The trailers are a convenience, not the only join.** `Discovery-Run` and
  `Discovery-Hypothesis` in the body are what rebuilds a lost report's filed rows, but the
  report may also carry the issue URLs outright, because an issue is public and a report of
  this run is not keeping anything back. Issues filed under this skill's former name,
  `refactor-discovery`, carry `Refactor-Run` and `Refactor-Hypothesis` instead, and a run
  reads both.
- **A label is an index**, so a person can find these without the trailers. The run still
  creates none: a repository's configuration is not a discovery run's to change.

## Which credential answered

Measured from this workspace's `gh`, against `dynamicagents/dev-agents`:

| call | status | `X-Accepted-Github-Permissions` |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `POST .../issues` with `{}` | `422 Unprocessable Entity`, body `Invalid request.\n\n"title" wasn't supplied.` | `issues=write` |
| `GET .../issues?state=all&per_page=1` | `200 OK` | `issues=read` |

The `422` is the green light `SKILL.md` step 3 looks for: the endpoint accepted the caller
and rejected the body, and **nothing was created**, confirmed by the repository's issue
count being unchanged immediately afterwards. A body with no `title` cannot create an
issue, which is what makes it safe to probe a mutating endpoint with.

The credential a CLI session uses is **not** the Worker's `GITHUB_TOKEN` binding (see
`starter/wrangler.jsonc` and the egress module in plugins' GitHub repo plugin). A scope
granted to the deployment does not reach a session, and the reverse is equally true, so
name which one refused when reporting a block.

GitHub documents `410 Gone` on the create path for a repository with issues turned off,
which would be a refusal nobody can clear with a permission: there is no issue route there
at all. **That one is from the documentation and not from a probe**, because every
repository in the train has issues enabled and this run turns nothing off to find out.

## File a finding

`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` (`issues=write`)

```bash
gh issue create -R dynamicagents/<repo> --label <label> \
  --title "<the root cause, as a sentence>" --body-file /tmp/issue-discovery/<n>.md
```

`title` is required and nothing else is. The reporter is the issue's author, which is what
makes the read-back below work.

### The label is the kind's

| kind | label |
| ---- | ----- |
| bug | `bug` |
| docs | `documentation` |
| test | `enhancement` |
| refactor | `enhancement` |

All three are GitHub's default labels, and `gh label list -R dynamicagents/<repo>` shows each
in every repository of the train: dev-agents, core, plugins, starter, g2a-protocol and
create-dynamicagents. A bundle passes one `--label` per kind it holds.

**What GitHub does with a label that does not exist is not established here**, and that is
the reason to name only these: a run cannot tell a silently created label from a silently
dropped one without checking afterwards, and checking afterwards is a second call that
proves the first was wrong. A repository that turns out to lack one is filed without it,
and the report says which.

### A create that fails with no answer

`gh issue create` goes through GraphQL, and it has answered
`GraphQL: Something went wrong while executing your query` with an incident reference:
measured on four of eleven creates in one run. **That answer does not say whether the issue
was created.** List the repository's issues and look for this run's `Discovery-Run` trailer
and title before retrying; retrying blind is how one finding gets two issues, and closing the
second is not this run's to do. In that run none had landed, and the retries produced no
duplicates.

### A finding whose effects reach other repositories

It is one issue, in the repository whose change removes the root cause, and its Follow-on
section says what each other repository does once it is fixed. A pull request in one of
those repositories names it as `Part of dynamicagents/<repo>#<n>`, and the last one as
`Fixes dynamicagents/<repo>#<n>`, which closes it on merge. **Closing across repositories is
from GitHub's documentation and not from a probe**: the keyword with an `owner/repo#n`
reference is documented to close an issue in another repository when the pull request
merges into its default branch, and this run opens no pull request to find out. Only the
last pull request may use the closing keyword, or the issue closes before its effects are
done.

## History: list, then inspect

`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?state=all` (`issues=read`)

```bash
gh issue list -R dynamicagents/<repo> --state all --limit 200 \
  --json number,title,state,stateReason,labels,url,body
gh issue view <n> -R dynamicagents/<repo> --json title,body,state,stateReason,comments
```

**`--state all` is not a default.** `gh issue list` shows open issues only, and a closed
issue is exactly the history this run most needs: a decision somebody already made. The
workspace `AGENTS.md` makes it a rule for every discovery run, under "What earlier runs and
earlier people already decided".

**`--limit` is this route's `--paginate`, and it is weaker.** `gh issue list` returns thirty
rows by default and says nothing about the ones it did not return, so a run reading the
default draws the same conclusion from a truncated answer as from a complete one. Unlike
`--paginate`, raising the limit does not make the answer complete, it only makes it bigger:
nothing in the output says whether more existed.

**So the only signal of truncation is a listing as full as its limit**, and a run reads it
as one: a page of exactly `--limit` rows means raise the limit and read again, until the
answer comes back short. A repository whose history never comes back short has incomplete
history, and `SKILL.md` step 9 hands its candidates back rather than filing them. The
alternative, counting on a limit chosen to be larger than any repository will ever hold, is
a count that is right until it is not and silent when it stops being.

**A bundle's disposition is per item, in its body.** The `body` the listing returns holds
the task list: `- [x]` is an item the fix covered, `- [ ]` is one it did not. Read with the
issue's `state` and its closing comment, that is the per-item reading `SKILL.md` step 9
applies.

Two ways this endpoint misleads a reader, both worth knowing before trusting a count:

- **The REST route returns pull requests as well as issues.** Measured: in `dev-agents`,
  when it had no issues at all, `GET /repos/dynamicagents/dev-agents/issues?state=all`
  answered with three pull requests, while `gh issue list` in the same repository answered
  with nothing. `gh issue list` filters them out; `gh api` does not, so a run that reaches
  for the REST route has to filter on `.pull_request == null` itself.
- **`stateReason` carries the category and never the argument.** `COMPLETED`,
  `NOT_PLANNED` and `DUPLICATE` are the ones the disposition table is keyed on, and it is
  absent on an issue nobody has closed. The reason a maintainer declined something is prose,
  in the closing comment, so the `view` call above is not optional: `--state all` finds the
  decision and only the comments say what it was.

The per-repository listing is authoritative. `gh search issues` reaches the trailers across
repositories and is a convenience for a person, not a substitute: a search index has its own
lag and its own scoring, and a run that read one and not the listing cannot say what it did
not see.

## Correcting one already filed: not a call this run makes

`PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}` would take a new title, body, state or
`state_reason`, and `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments` would add a
comment. **A discovery run calls neither**, for the reason it edits no record anywhere: a
record that can be amended is no longer the account of the run that wrote it, and closing
is the owner's. Ticking a bundle's box is the owner's too, done by the fix. A correction is a
new issue naming the one it supersedes, which is the same move the disposition table asks
for when a fixed finding comes back: the workspace `AGENTS.md`, under "What earlier runs and
earlier people already decided", reached from `SKILL.md` step 9.

That is also why issues of one run carry no cross-written issue numbers. The numbers are
only knowable after the issues exist, so writing them in would mean editing each issue once
the rest were filed. The report carries the full set of URLs instead.
